This project contains example code for working with [SCIFIO][1].


GETTING STARTED
---------------

These tutorials are heavily commented to explain the SCIFIO API.
Simply running a given tutorial may not be meaningful; it is
highly recommended to open the source files and follow the code
step by step.

You can import these projects into your favorite IDE:

  * Eclipse: File > Import > Existing Maven Projects
  * NetBeans: File > Open Project
  * IDEA: File > Open Project... (select pom.xml)

Or build and run from the command line:

    mvn
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=io.scif.tutorials.T1aIntroToSCIFIO

TUTORIAL ORDER
-------------
SCIFIO provides multiple paths to read and write images. Convenience
methods are present to make the IO process as simple as possible. The
individual components of SCIFIO allow more precise control.

The tutorials are named in a suggested order for execution:
  * Tutorials 1a-d focus on basic image IO using convenience methods
  * Tutorials 2a-b cover individual component use
  * Tutorials 3a-b explain the discovery mechanism and defining
    your own SCIFIO Formats and components.

LICENSING
---------
